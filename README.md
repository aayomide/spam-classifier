## Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Algorithm
In this project, I used `Multinomial Naive Bayes` to "teach" the computer how to identify spam messages from non-spam ones AND integrated the model in a minimal web app.

Interact with the live webapp here: [aayomide-spam_identifier](https://young-tor-29538.herokuapp.com/). Just paste your message in the textbox and click `classify` to check whether the message is spam or not


A dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans were used for the project. The original dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). You can also download the dataset directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection). The data collection process is described in more details on this page, where you can also find some of the authors' papers.
