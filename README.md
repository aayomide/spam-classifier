## Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Algorithm
In this project, I used `Multinomial Naive Bayes` to "teach" the computer how to identify spam messages from non-spam ones. A dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans were used for this. 

I also deployed the model on a web page, click [here](https://young-tor-29538.herokuapp.com/) to explore it. Just paste your message in the textbox and click `classify` to check whether the message is spam or not

The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). You can also download the dataset directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection). The data collection process is described in more details on this page, where you can also find some of the authors' papers.
