## Spam Filter using Naive Bayes Algorithm
In this project, I used `Multinomial Naive Bayes` to "teach" the computer how to identify spam messages from non-spam ones. A dataset of 5,572 SMS messages that are already classified by humans were used for this.

The dataset was put together by Tiago A. Almeida and José María Gómez Hidalgo, and it can be downloaded from the The [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection). You can also download the dataset directly from this [link](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/433/SMSSpamCollection). The data collection process is described in more details on this page, where you can also find some of the authors' papers.
